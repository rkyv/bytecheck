# Support for various common crates. These are primarily to get users off the ground and build some
# momentum.

# These are NOT PLANNED to remain in bytecheck for the final release. Much like serde, these
# implementations should be moved into their respective crates over time. Before adding support for
# another crate, please consider getting bytecheck support in the crate instead.
